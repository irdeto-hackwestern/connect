 I've included the zpx executible in this repo, it was part of a malware package that I analysed a few years back. Due to sloppy code sanitation I was able to reverse engineer it 
in a short time. This malware was for Android, and likely would not function on a recent device but DONT try to run it, bad things could happen!

The first level packer is UPX;
https://github.com/upx/upx

There is a second level packer, that is for you to discover!

Have fun!
